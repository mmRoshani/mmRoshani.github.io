Here we are going to overview the Kubernetes components. The components are:

- Pod
- Service
- ConfigMap
- Deployment
- Ingress
- Secret
- StatefulSet

Before explaning each component one might need to the definition of **Node** in Kubernetes. The Node (A.K.A **Worker Node**) is a physical or virtual machine that Kubernetes is installed on.
One Worker Node is the minimum requirment for a Kubernetes cluster.

## Pod

The **Pod** is the smallest unit in Kubenetes ecosystem. The usage of Pod is to create an abstraction layer on top of contranerization tecknology, for instance docker containers.
It is common to run one application inside one Pod. The application it self might includes multiple containers
