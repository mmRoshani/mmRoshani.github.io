## In this tutorial we will make and setup real-world kubernetes cluster.

### Pre-Requiests

The setup configuration contains three docker, each specifys one **Worker Node** in our cluster. Due to my location there are
may problems with ubuntu base server so I selected my favarote linux distroy for installing and using _docker_, _k8s utitlities_ and
that is a lovly **Arch Linux**.

first one must clone the [this repostory](https://) that include **docker-compose** file for downloading, building and running stages. For not having
403 errors i will use **AUR** and **yay** pacakge manager, so the building stage includes getting, testing and updating the mirrors and might be time consumming
based on your enternet connection.
